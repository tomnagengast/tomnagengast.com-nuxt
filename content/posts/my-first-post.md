# Not just what you read but how

The concept of a media diet has gotten a lot of attention, and it's surely an important one. If you fill your mind with drivel, it'll soak your thoughts in kind. But how you choose to fill your mind matters too. Even if the sources are ace.

For many years, I<!--more--> consumed media in a continuous, never-ending stream from morning till night. I'd go to the same websites several times per day, just checking, seeing what's new, then reading right away anything I found compelling. Add to that the flood of links and opinions consumed through Twitter all day long. When you graze on media like this, you're never done.

That idea of being done was the most compelling part of receiving a print newspaper, which is something we did for a while before moving during the pandemic. There's just a fixed number of pages. You scan through, find a few things to read, and then eventually reach the last page, and it's finished. No more news or opinions until the next day!

I still think the print newspaper has a lot going for it. That delightful combination of done with a way of reading that's free not only from internet comments but also screens altogether. Let's face it, though, most people are just not going to go back to print.

That doesn't mean you have to give up on done.

To focused reading, to filtered writing ðŸ¥‚
